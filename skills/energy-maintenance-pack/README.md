# Energy Maintenance Intelligence Pack

A domain-specific AI skill pack designed for renewable energy asset management and condition-based maintenance.

## Current Modules

### Gearbox Intelligence (v1.0.0)

Evaluates wind turbine gearbox condition using:

- Visual inspection findings (borescope)
- Oil iron (Fe ppm) analysis
- Vibration status
- Temperature anomalies

Outputs:

- Root cause assessment
- Severity classification (1–5)
- Shutdown recommendation
- Monitoring strategy
- Escalation triggers

---

## Roadmap

Planned extensions:

- Yaw Bearing Intelligence
- Pitch System Diagnostics
- CMS Trend Anomaly Interpreter
- Thermal Deviation Risk Modeling

---

## Vision

This pack explores how AI agents can support structured industrial decision-making in renewable energy operations.

The goal is to provide deterministic, explainable, and maintenance-aligned reasoning for wind turbine diagnostics.
